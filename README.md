![Export My Data Logo/Banner (Optional)](assets/images/logo.png) A lightweight, open-source project by the **Modcore Team** that provides a public archive of data export options for online services. Empowering users by making data portability information easily accessible.

## üß© Core Concept

In an age where our digital lives are intertwined with countless online services, understanding how to manage and export our data is more crucial than ever. "Export My Data" aims to be your go-to resource for answering critical questions about your data's portability:

* **Which services let users export their data?**
* **What formats are offered?** (e.g., JSON, ZIP, CSV)
* **Is account deletion required first?**
* **How long does the process typically take?**
* **Direct links** to the export pages.
* **Optional notes** (e.g., "must verify email", "only via app").

Our goal is to make this information transparent, easy to find, and continuously updated by the community.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You just need a web browser!

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/modcoretech/export-my-data.git](https://github.com/modcoretech/export-my-data.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd export-my-data
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

    Alternatively, you can set up a local web server (e.g., using Python's `http.server` or Node.js's `live-server`) for a more robust development experience, especially if you encounter CORS issues with `file://` protocol.

    ```bash
    # Using Python (if installed)
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
